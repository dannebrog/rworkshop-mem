# rworkshop-mem

Materials for the R workshop for Duke Master of Engineering Management students
on October 12, 2015.

This workshop assumes no background in R but willingness to learn a scripting
language.

Focus of the workshop is data wrangling and visualization, and not statistical
data analysis.
